## About GraphQL and Apollo

This library is meant to be used with Apollo on the **client** side but
you're free to use any graphql server.

Note that this client is **not** compatible with [graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/). However, another client exists for graphcool: [aor-graph-cool-client](https://github.com/mulyoved/aor-simple-graphql-client).

## Installation

Install with:

```sh
npm install --save aor-simple-graphql-client
```

or

```sh
yarn add aor-simple-graphql-client
```

## Usage

Let's create a file for our admin page `admin.js`:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { buildApolloClient } from 'aor-simple-graphql-client';

import { Admin, Resource } from 'admin-on-rest';
import { Delete } from 'admin-on-rest/lib/mui';

import { PostCreate, PostEdit, PostList } from '../components/admin/posts';

const client = new ApolloClient();

class AdminPage extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = { restClient: null };
    }
    componentDidMount() {
        buildApolloClient()
            .then(restClient => this.setState({ restClient }));
    }

    render() {
        const { restClient } = this.state;

        if (!restClient) {
            return <div>Loading</div>;
        }

        return (
            <Admin restClient={restClient}>
                <Resource name="Post" list={PostList} edit={PostEdit} create={PostCreate} remove={Delete} />
            </Admin>
        );
    }
}

export default AdminPage;
```

And that's it, `buildApolloClient` will create a default ApolloClient for you and
run an introspection query on your graphql endpoint.

By default, it expect the following queries and mutations for each resource:

### List resources with pagination

Example with resource `Post`:

```graphql
getPageOfPosts(page: Int, perPage: Int, sortField: String, sortOrder: String, filter: String) {
    items: [Post]
    totalCount: Int
}
```

Note that the function should be named with the plural version of `Post`.
We use [pluralize](https://github.com/blakeembrey/pluralize) to generate it.

`filter` may contain a serialized JSON object, for example:

```js
'{ "authorId": "4e80878c-6baa-4506-a93c-ef99b74e73e0" }'
```

### Get a resource

Example with resource `Post`:

```graphql
getPost(id: ID!) Post
```

### Create a new resource

Example with resource `Post`:

```graphql
createPost(data: String) Post
```

`data` is a serialized JSON object, for example:

```js
'{ "title": "My first post", "authorId": "4e80878c-6baa-4506-a93c-ef99b74e73e0", "body": "..." }'
```

### Update a resource

Example with resource `Post`:

```graphql
updatePost(data: String) Post
```

`data` is a serialized JSON object, for example:

```js
'{ "id": "c02e92e8-2a21-4ae7-9197-cb9601861a44", "title": "My first post", "authorId": "4e80878c-6baa-4506-a93c-ef99b74e73e0", "body": "..." }'
```

### Remove a resource

Example with resource `Post`:

```graphql
removePost(id: ID!) Boolean
```

## Options

### Customize the Apollo client

You can either supply the client options by calling `buildApolloClient` like this:

```js
buildApolloClient({ clientOptions: { uri: 'http://localhost:3000', ...otherApolloOptions } });
```

Or supply your client directly with:

```js
buildApolloClient({ client: myClient });
```

### GraphQL flavor

A flavor act as the translator between Admin-on-rest requests and your GraphQL queries and mutations.

This is useful if you want more control over which paramaters are sent from Admin-on-rest to your GraphQL backend, and how they are sent.

A flavor is an object with a key for each rest action defined by Admin-on-rest: `GET_ONE`, `GET_LIST`, `GET_MANY`, `GET_MANY_REFERENCE`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.

For each of these actions, it defines:

- how the name of the operation (query or mutation) can be inferred during introspection
- how the query will be generated through introspection
- how parameters are translated from Admin-on-rest to Apollo
- how the query results from Apollo to Admin-on-rest are parsed

For example, this is the `GET_LIST` definition in the [default](https://github.com/marmelab/aor-simple-graphql-client/tree/master/src/flavors/default.js) flavor:

```js
export default {
    [GET_LIST]: {
        operationName: resourceType => `getPageOf${pluralize(resourceType.name)}`,
        getParameters: params => ({
            filter: JSON.stringify(params.filter),
            page: params.pagination.page - 1,
            perPage: params.pagination.perPage,
            sortField: params.sort.field,
            sortOrder: params.sort.order,
        }),
    },
    ...
};
```

To define a custom GraphQL flavor, pass it in the options:

```js
buildApolloClient({ flavor: myGraphCoolFlavor });
```

### Customize the introspection

These are the default options for introspection:

```js
const introspectionOptions = {
    includeTypes: null, // Either an array of types to include or a function which will be called with each OBJECT type discovered through introspection
    excludeTypes: null, // Either an array of types to exclude or a function which will be called with each OBJECT type discovered through introspection (`Query` and `Mutation` are excluded anyway)
    includeQueries: null, // Either an array of queries to include or a function which will be called with each query discovered through introspection
    excludeQueries: null, // Either an array of queries to exclude or a function which will be called with each query discovered through introspection
    includeMutations: null, // Either an array of mutations to include or a function which will be called with each mutation discovered through introspection
    excludeMutations: null, // Either an array of mutations to exclude or a function which will be called with each mutation discovered through introspection
    excludeFields: null, // Either an array of fields to exclude or a function which will be called with each field discovered through introspection on a specific object (more details below)
    ignoreSubObjects: true, // If true, introspection will ignore sub objects AND sub resources from the returned fields (more details below)
    ignoreSubResources: true, // If true and ignoreSubObjects is false, introspection will ignore sub resources from the returned fields (more details below)
}
```

And how you pass them to the `buildApolloClient` function:

```js
buildApolloClient({ introspection: introspectionOptions });
```

**Note**: `excludeXXX` and `includeXXX` are mutualy exclusives and `includeXXX` will always take precendance.

`excludeFields` deserves more details. If supplying a function, it will receive the following parameters:

- `field`: the field definition (see the documentation on
    [introspection](http://graphql.org/learn/introspection/) for more details)
- `resource`: the resource type (for example: `Post`)
- `type`: the operation type (matching those of **admin-on-rest**, for example: `GET_LIST`)

`ignoreSubObjects` can be set to `false` to include sub objects in queries and mutations results. Consider the following GQL schema:

```
    type Customer {
        id ID!
        name String
    }

    type Product {
        id ID!
        reference String
    }

    type OrderItem {
        productId ID!
        product Product
        quantity Int
    }

    type Order {
        id ID!
        customerId ID!
        customer Customer
        date Date
        items: [OrderItem]
    }
```

If `ignoreSubObjects` is `true` (the default) and `ignoreSubResources` is `true` (the default), the `getOrder` query will be generated like this:

```
    getOrder(id ID!) {
        id
        customerId
        date
    }
```

If `ignoreSubObjects` is `false` and `ignoreSubResources` is `true`, the `getOrder` query will be generated like this:

```
    getOrder(id ID!) {
        id
        customerId
        date
        items {
            productId
            quantity
        }
    }
```

If `ignoreSubObjects` is `false` and `ignoreSubResources` is `false`, the `getOrder` query will be generated like this:

```
    getOrder(id ID!) {
        id
        customerId
        customer { id name }
        date
        items {
            productId
            product { id reference }
            quantity
        }
    }
```

**Note**: Remember that those two options could lead to recursive loading of many resources. Use them with caution.

### Supply your own queries and mutations

You need even more control? Then provide your queries with the following format:

```js
const queries = {
    Post: {
        GET_LIST: () => gql`your query`, // Variables will be: { page: Int, perPage: Int, sortFilter: String, sortOrder: String, filter: String }
        GET_MANY: () => gql`your query`, // Optional, see note below. Variables will be: { filter: String }
        GET_MANY_REFERENCE: () => gql`your query`, // Optional, see note below. Variables will be: { filter: String }
        GET_ONE: () => gql`your query`, // Variables will be: { id: ID }
        CREATE: () => gql`your query`, // Variables will be: { data: String }
        UPDATE: () => gql`your query`, // Variables will be: { data: String }
        DELETE: () => gql`your query`, // Variables will be: { id: ID }
    }
}
```

```js
buildApolloClient({ queries });
```

**Note**: You can mix introspection and custom queries by just supplying your custom queries.
If you want to disable introspection, set the `introspection` option to `false`.

```js
buildApolloClient({ queries, introspection: false });
```

## Realtime updates

**DICLAIMER** This is currently not stable. We have only tested the Apollo polling mechanisms. We still have to investigate subscriptions.

Using ApolloClient, one is able to get real time updates when data changes:
see their [documentation](http://dev.apollodata.com/core/apollo-client-api.html#ApolloClient\.watchQuery) for details.

With `aor-simple-graphql-client`, you can enable real time updates like this:

```js
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { buildApolloClient } from 'aor-simple-graphql-client';

import { Admin, Resource } from 'admin-on-rest';
import { Delete } from 'admin-on-rest/lib/mui';

import { PostCreate, PostEdit, PostList } from '../components/admin/posts';

const client = new ApolloClient();

class AdminPage extends Component {
    constructor() {
        super();
        this.state = { restClient: null };
    }
    componentDidMount() {
        buildApolloClient()
            .then(restClient => this.setState({ restClient }));
    }

    render() {
        const { restClient } = this.state;

        if (!restClient) {
            return <div>Loading</div>;
        }

        return (
            <Admin restClient={restClient} customSagas={[restClient.saga()]}>
                <Resource name="Post" list={PostList} edit={PostEdit} create={PostCreate} remove={Delete} />
            </Admin>
        );
    }
}

export default AdminPage;
```

We simply pass a custom [saga](https://marmelab.com/admin-on-rest/AdminResource.html#customsagas)
to the `Admin` component.

By default, it will use the Apollo polling mechanism with a `pollInterval` of 2 seconds for all
`GET_LIST` and `GET_ONE` requests.

### Customization

You can specify the options to pass to the [watchQuery](http://dev.apollodata.com/core/apollo-client-api.html#ApolloClient\.watchQuery)
function:


#### For all resources and request types

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = {
        pollInterval: 10000,
    };

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```

Or, you can supply a function instead of an object and it will be call
with `resource` and `requestType` parameters:

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = (resource, requestType) => ({
        pollInterval: 10000,
    });

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```

#### For a specific resources and all request types

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = {
        Post: {
            pollInterval: 10000,
        },
        Comment: {
            pollInterval: 5000,
        },
    };

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```

Or, you can supply a function instead of an object and it will be call
with a `requestType` parameter:

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = (resource, requestType) => {
        Post: {
            pollInterval: 10000,
        },
        Comment: {
            (requestType): => ({
                pollInterval: 5000,
            }),
        },
    };

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```

#### For a specific resources and request type

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = {
        Post: {
            pollInterval: 2000,
        },
        Comment: {
            GET_ONE: {
                pollInterval: 10000,
            },
            GET_LIST: {
                pollInterval: 5000,
            },
        },
    };

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```

Or, you can supply a function instead of an object:

```js
    const apolloWatchOptions = (resource, requestType) => {
        Post: {
            pollInterval: 10000,
        },
        Comment: {
            GET_ONE: {
                pollInterval: 10000,
            },
            GET_LIST: {
                (): => ({
                    pollInterval: 5000,
                }),
            },
        },
    };

    const apolloSaga = restClient.saga(apolloWatchOptions);
```
